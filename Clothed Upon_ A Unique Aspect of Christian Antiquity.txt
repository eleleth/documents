Ostler: Clothed Upon: A Unique Aspect of Christian Antiquity

common to many manuscripts 9 christ does not go to the wicked
however he goes to his former prophets to organize an ecclesia after
which they all receive the appay&
acppayis or seal that represents baptism
for the dead and they mount up to heaven together as resurrected
beings 10 the preaching in the spirit world is left up to the apostles
who also administer a vicarious baptism for the dead I1nI1 although cer-
tain of these doctrines are specific to gnostic christianity or specific
sects of the jews around the first century CE the salvific framework
presupposed in these texts is found in both

the idea of the garment is completely at home throughout the
ancient world always in connection with ordinances of initiation
the garment is usually mentioned in rela-
related to the endowment
tion with other ordinances especially the anointing in the slavonic
go and take enoch
enoch for example the lord tells michael
from out of his earthly garments and anoint him with my sweet oint-
12 the testament
ment and put him into the garments of my glory
oflevi a work closely related to the dead sea scrolls
tells us that in a
dream levi

raiment saying unto me-

saw seven men inin white raiment
arise put on the
robe of the priesthood and the crown of righteousness and the breast-
plate of understanding and the garment of truth and the plate of
then
faith and the turban of the head and the ephod of prophecy
each of them brought forward a thing and put it on me and said unto
from henceforth become a priest of the lord and thou and thy
me
and the first man anointed me with holy oil and gave
seed forever
the second washed me with pure water
me a staff of judgement
judgement
fed
the
me with bread and holy wine and clad me with a glorious robe
third clothed me with a linen vestment like an ephod the fourth put
round me a girdle like unto purple 13

the scene portrayed in the testament of levi recalls the in-
vestiture of the king and high priests at the temple on the occasion of
year rites which rites take us back to the earliest records of history 14
the anointing was not always the simple anointing of the head but
often refers to a more complete anointing of all the various parts of
cyril of jerusalem who initiated a revival of temple
the body
told the newly
ordinances albeit a specious and short lived revival
initiated neophytes of the fourth century

you have received the first anointing on your brow to deliver you from
the shame of the first man for having transgressed the law and that you
may reflect on the glory of christ
that you
the
might hear and properly understand the divine mysteries
that by so receiving the holy or-
third anointing on the nostrils
dinances you say we are the sweet odor of christ to the saved of
dinances
god
after that you were anointed on the breast and clothed with a
breastplate of righteousness 15
cyril mentioned an anointing of

the second on the ears

ie eyes
ears nose mouth and brow while theodore of mopsuestia
Mopsuestia men-
tioned an anointing of the whole body that is
the sign that you will
this ordinance of
be clothed on with a garment of immortality
anointing bears a certain affinity with the egyptian ceremony of the
opening of the mouth 17

the five senses

the reception of the garment became an ordinance perpersese closely
like baptism putting on a
associated with baptismal washings 18
new garment represented putting off the old man and being clothed
and putting on a resurrected body after symbolic death
in
the early christian or late jewish odes of solomon abound in the
symbolism of baptism and tie the garment to the baptismal ritual
1I
stripped off sin and cast it from me and the lord renewed me in his
1 I1 put off darkness and clothed myself

in the pistis sophia a gnostic text of great importance the gar-
ment is marked with the sacred name and with five mysteries 2171 one
in gnostic speculation through receiv-
symbolically puts on christ
ing basptism and the garment 22

that garment

the ancient garment was adorned with other marks besides the
name E goodenough in his study ofjewish
ofjewish symbolism discovered
that in christian art the garment and robe were marked with signs at
right angles the gamma or square or simply with a straight bar with
prongs he concluded that the marks had some religious significance
or symbolic force 23 it should be noted that the ancient garment bore
jerusalem in the testa-
the same tokens as the veil of the temple at atjerusalem
coujLia of the angel or the
ment oflevi for example the veil is the zv8vtta
coujlia
personified temple 24 many ancient texts confuse the garment with
the veil of the temple such as ambrose of milanos tractate of the
and
mysteries or the hebrew book of enoch where
are used interchangeably 25 enoch is clothed with the veil in

made me a throne similar to the throne of glory
and he spread over me a curtain veil of splendour and brilliant ap-
pearance of beauty grace and mercy similar to the curtain veil of the

adeberg
according to hugo odeberg
Odeberg who translated the hebrew enoch
the secrets of the worlds creation and
the veil was marked with
27 the pur-
in short
sustenance
pose of the marks on the garment and the veil was to initiate the
recipient into the divine secrets of the universe
enoch also received a
the holy one
garment that was marked with divine secrets
made me a garment of glory on which were fixed all kinds of lights
and he clad me in it and he made a robe of honour on which were
fixed all kinds of beauty

the innermost divine secrets

each step of progress in initiation was marked by some change of
the garment or robes and so the symbolism of the garment implied
in the
increased glory moving from one existence to another
dialogue of the savior judas and matthew ask christ we wish to
know with what kind of garments we will be clothed when we come
forth from the corruption of this world
since
you are sons of truth it is not with these temporary garments that you
of philip the lord adds that
will clothe yourselves
in this
world those who put on garments are better than the garments
in
the kingdom of heaven the garments are better than those who put
them on

it is necessary to rise in the flesh since everything exists in it

in the gospel ofphilip

the lord replies

in the pearl

the garment also represented the preexistent purity of the ini-
tiate and as such it represented blessings stored up in heaven to
that all important early chris-
which the soul returns
tian work the soul is reared in its preexistent palace of glory but it
must leave behind this glory in order to sojourn on the earth for a
period of probation upon his leaving the preexistent palace says the
they removed from me the garment of light which they had

A...lijn states that the idea of preexistence

preexistence comes from
judaism where the idea of the heavenly robe may be taken from
34 of course he refers
the description of adam and eve in paradise
to the tradition that adams nature was like bright light before the
fall even as the garment is a garment of light but after the fall
adam lost his preexistent glory 3355 J rendel harris points out that the
odes ofsolomon
pre existent soul that
has to leave heaven for earth and that of the unfallen creation of
god whose environment is changed from a coat of light to a coat of
garment of light
skins
possibly because the hebrew ar1r afomfo coat of skins
so closely
resembles lintintl15n ahrohro11nlnhrcnrc
even so the
apocryphon ofjames
of james tells us that when the spirit returns to its
heavenly treasure itit will become
as you were first having clothed
yourself you become the first who will strip himself and you shall
become as you were before removing the garment

of solomon also contain the ideas of

the garment of skins

the preexistent

coat of light

became the

meaning

the garment also represents the treasure laid up in heaven
awaiting the souls return and in this context
the glory of the resur-
rected body 38 an ancient christian writing known as the ascension

enoch is replete with references to garments
in connection with the
and the righteous and elect
resurrection the book of enoch says
shall have risen from the earth and ceased to be downcast in counte-
and they shall be clothed with garments of glory and they
nance
40 the manual
shall be the garments of life from the lord of spirits
of discipline found among the dead sea scrolls contains a concept
very similar to that of the book of enoch

the essenes

and as for the visitation of all who walk inm this spirit of truth it shall be
healing great peace inm a long life and fruitfulness together with every
everlasting blessing and eternal joy in life without end a crown of glory
and a garment of majesty in unending light 41

Covenantorsers believed that the righteous
covenanters
become priests and kings together with everlasting progeny or eternal
espenes gave a white robe
families E goodenough states that
of holiness to each new member to mark his entry into the order
that is upon his initiation and thereafter he wore white always
the throne and crown are often mentioned in relation to garments
because the rites involved are properly a type of coronation where
every initiate is anointed and blessed to become
a priest and king to
the most high god 43
the concept of a garment received in the
the spirit and the
resurrection is found in the book of mormon
and the righteous shall
body shall be restored to itself again
have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment and their righteous-
ness being clothed with purity even with a robe of righteousness

then to noah ham stole noahsmoahs garment from him while noah was
sleeping upon awaking noah blessed his two sons but cursed ham
because ham had stolen the garment 59 abraham also had to deal
in the apocalypse of abraham when satan
with garment robbers

the necessary
mysteries christ put on his garment and
arose on high to the door

simultaneously when the ixpxcovt
arconti and powers and angels
they saw my shin-
saw the light of the garment they were overcome
ing and resplendent garment that I1 had put on they saw the mystery
on which was written their name and they were much disturbed
63
the garment here is a means to pass by the angels stationed to block
the way to the gate of heaven

qpcjnq arconts

the necessity of royal garments to pass through the gates and
hugo

into the presence of god is another very ancient concept
adeberg has characterized the garment of glory as

probably conceived of as a reflection

outflow of the divine glory the splendour of the shekina the putting
is a necessary condition of entering the

given to those entering the presence of the gods

goddess is arrayed in seven ordinances

the changing of robes had long been a very significant
for example in the very old pyramid texts the garment was
take thy

in the sumerian myth of inanna
the
dinanna
she covers her body with the
queenship she then descends to
the gate of the netherworld where she is met by the typical question
response of the gatekeeper who art thou
why hast thou
the gatekeeper checks her for each ofotherher seven ordinances

inanna
dinanna enters the netherworld to be judged and then to
separately
be confined for three days and three nights
the
food of life and the water of life
she is sprinkled with water and
ascends from the netherworld in a manner reminiscent of the early
christian accounts of christs descensus

quent ascension 66

the ancient texts make it perfectly clear that the candidate must
yvuais or the name of god in
be properly clothed and possess the ypatg
order to pass through the last barrier to the presence of god in many
documents the prophet passes through seven heavens and must
receive a garment of glory to enter into the highest heaven where god
the garment becomes brighter as the prophet passes through
dwells
the prophet must also possess the proper
each successive heaven
identification or sign in order to enter each heaven 69
in the
apocalypse of paul for instance paul passes through seven heavens
and comes to the gate guarded by
the spirit his guide tells paul
and he will open to you and I1 gave him the sign
heaven opened 70
illustration of the necessity of both the garment and the name
no man shall enter into the kingdom of heaven except he shall take
the gate is the son of
upon him the name of the
god who is the only way of coming to god
no man can enter

A man shall in vain bear

availeth nothing to take up the name of the

son of god
garment
unless thou shalt receive the garment
his name unless he is endowed with his powers 71
christ is also represented as the door to the kingdom of heaven in
he gave me the way of his precepts and I1
nothing appeared closed to

the scene at the gate is often one of intimate union
ofjames after the spirit is clothed

the odes of solomon

again with its garment christ tells the apostle
know that you
behold I1 shall reveal everything to you my beloved
come forth just as I1 am behold I1 shall reveal to you him who is hid-
den now stretch out your hand now take hold of me
those
who wish to enter and seek to walk in the way that is before the door
open the door through you 72
the book of mormon also refers to the straight way before the

gate and identifies the holy one of israel with the gatekeeper
the way for man is narrow but it lieth in a straight course before
him and the keeper of the gate is the holy one of israel and he
employ eth no servant there and there is no way save it be by the gate
employeth
for he cannot be deceived for the lord god is his name 73717 1
